*Makefile was modifed to make me able to run without all the code. So please copy over original Makefile from ori repo when done.

- Changes by Oct 27
1. proc.c:
	- modified allocproc
		- it's the main entry point of creating process, so we assign default values to process and recompute global
	- modified scheduler()
		- where we perform the algorithm of the stride scheduler, uses ticklock and ticks to increment tickTaken of proc.
	- modified exit()
		- this is the main exit point of proc and so we recompute global everytime we exit

2. pstat.h:
	- added the headers as specified on README.md
3. trap.c:
	- every timer interupt we will increment the global pass by current stride
