Analysis:

- RR
- This scheduler schedules the process whenever the next one is in the loop and in the csv (from workload), we can see that the run time for all processes increased with same proportion (very close to exact same)

- Stride Scheduler
- This scheduler schedules the process that have more tickets and it shows in the csv that the growth of the run time is with similar proportion to the tickets the process holds. Note that the csv shows how processes started late will not catch up to the process with same tickets that ran before them but increase with the same proportion in runtime as them.
